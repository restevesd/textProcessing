## Project

The objective of this project is a web application that predicts a word that a preson is going to write.It works as very simple, in the text input a user enter few words and the press the button "__Predict next word__". Then, on the right hand panel, one can see the next word.


### Data

Train data contains about 550MB of text that are tweets, news, blogs. It is XXXX lines that we process by removing everything that is not a letter, then we lower case them.

### Processing data

From each line of data we create 1, 2 and grams. Since that dataset is huge it was hard to process it using R. We have decied to write a C code that creates Binary Search Trees of grams. Then we create csv files with created grams and frequecies of each gram.

## Simples model

The most popular 1-gram is the word "the". So if there is no other data we provide it as the default next word. 
The 2-grams we treat as follows. We group then by the first word and then we find the most popular second word. This word is the predicted word if the prevous word is provided. Similary we treat 3-grams. We group them by the first and second word and we find the third most popular word. 

Since the free shiny server has restictions of size of files we consider only grams that have appeared at least twice.

## Accuracy

The accuracy of restriced model is 16%.
